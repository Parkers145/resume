# Drew Smith, A Leader for Communities Working Towards Decentralization 
(note! The sections marked with triangles are expandable)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Drew, and I'm not your traditional Candidate for a role in tech and I think that is a great thing for both of us. I have spent the last 7 years working in healthcare as Paramedic/EMT. During that time I have gained invaluable and irreplaceable experience in not only interfacing with people from every background but training people to also have the ability to inteface with others themselves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my professional career I have always maintained a passion for technology and how it can help people to know more, do more, and be healthier. The growing centralization and abuse of people's data, has led me over the past year to become deeply involved in a project called [Threefold](https://threefold.io), where I have been functioning as a:

In order to complete these tasks I have relied on my skillsets that include 

- Basic Linux scripting 
- Drafting of technical documentation & tutorials 
- Supporting users in the development of new ways to use a product
- Driving decentralized development of technology
- Production of written and video tutorials 
- Managing live digital presentations & events
- Training users and staff members on technolgies being developed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In performing this work over the past year I have felt a renewed passion and satisfaction in doing this type of work, this has allowed to accomplish these things while maintaining a full time job as paramedic with the minimal resource of just my laptop and Threefold Grid deployments. In recent weeks I have been working on a project to deploy Umbrel on the Threefold Grid and discovered that you are currently hiring. It is with great excitement that I would like to submit my candidacy to you for your Community, Communications and Marketing position, or any postion that you feel I could contribute to the success of your project. Now that we know how I can contribute to the team lets tell you a little about me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pride myself on taking ownership of both projects and finding solutions to problems. As a Leader, I believe the key to sucess is finding, developing and encouraging the talent within the people that you are working with. I believe that 
- A leader is first a servant and enabler to his team
- All teams should strive to always have open and clear communication  
- Everyone should be able to contribute to a project in the way that maximizes their contribution with the lowest cost to their other needs. 

I hope that you will find my skills and values align with yours in way that would allow me to contribute to your company's vision and success, I look forward to hearing from you about how I can contribute! I do not currently work for The Threefold project I used in the demonstrations in this document, and they are not in a position to hire anyone, but the CEO and Founder, Kristof De Spiegeleer, supports me in my pursuit of joining your team, he can be reached on Telegram at https://t.me/despiegk, if a reference is needed.
